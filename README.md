# Intuitive Neural Network
### When would like to understand what's going on without the mathematics!
A JavaScript based, object-orientated approach to a Neural Network library.

The two aims behind creating this library are:
1. **Intuition** - To create a neural network library that is intuitive, breaking away from the mathematical representations of neural networks, and allowing them to be represented as an actual 'network' of neurons firing down synapses and activating one-another.
2. **Built with JavaScript** - More accessable. JavaScript copes well with running neural networks, even with a less mathematical, more object-orientated approach.
